## Configuring the Application

A lot of configuration changes based on the environment Lucky is running in. Development, test or production.

The default environments in a Lucky app are

* `development`
* `test`
* `production`

## Get the current environment

`LuckyEnv.name` will return the currently running environment

Or, conditionally check the environment with `LuckyEnv.test?` , `LuckyEnv.development?` or `LuckyEnv.production?`

## Set the current environment

`LUCKY_ENV=environment_name` to set the environment. By default it is `development`

## Adding more environments

Fill in later.

## Where to put configuration

All application configuration is found in the `config` folder

For example, to change the database config, look in `config/database.cr`

## Configuring your own code

Lucky ships with `Habitat`. A module you can use to configure your application in a type safe way.

Check out the Habitat documentation to see how to use it in your app
