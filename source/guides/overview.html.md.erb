  This guide will give a brief intro to the philosophy behind Lucky. It also
  goes over the file structure of a Lucky app, and how all the pieces fit
  together.

## File structure overview

A new Lucky app is a slightly modified version of a Crystal app.

### `src` folder

The src folder holds most of your application code. This includes actions for handling requests,
queries for database access, pages for rendering HTML, and a few other things.

### `config` folder

Here are all the files for configuring your application. A new app comes with a
few configuration files, but you can add more as you see fit.

### `static` folder

This is where all your static assets go. JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, and
anything other assets your project needs.

### `db` folder

This folder houses all the database migrations for your app.

### `tasks` folder

You can put custom tasks here that can be run by the `lucky` command line tool.

### `public` folder

This file is never written to by a developer. Instead the asset compiler will
put files here automatically.

### `Procfile` and `Procfile.dev`

`Procfile.dev` is used when you run `lucky dev`. By default there is a web and an assets process
that are started. You can add more if you need them.

`Procfile` is often used in production. Companies like Heroku, use it to determine
how it should run the app.
