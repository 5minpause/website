## To get Lucky, you need to install these first

* Heroku CLI (later Lucky will support foreman, and forego as well)
* Node
* Yarn
* Crystal
* Postgres

## Once those are installed, get Lucky set up

```crystal
class User
  # Something cool
end
```

### On macOS,

Make sure you have home-brew, then run `brew install lucky`

### On Linux machines

* Do a bunch of other crap
