## Install Required Dependencies

To get Lucky, you need to install these first

* Heroku CLI (later Lucky will support foreman, and forego as well)
* Node
* Yarn
* Crystal
* Postgres

## Install Lucky

Once the required dependencies are installed, set up Lucky for your system

### On macOS:

Make sure you have home-brew, then run `brew install lucky`

### On Linux machines:

* Do a bunch of other crap

## Start a New Project

To start a new project, run `lucky init {project_name}`.

So if you wanted to start a new app for your blog you might do:

```
lucky init my_blog
```
